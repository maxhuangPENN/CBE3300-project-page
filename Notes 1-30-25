Discussed the merits of liquid vs. vapor feed for MeOH.
Considered alloys for electrodes
Have not considered cost so far
In the MeOH reduction mechanism, there is CO as byproduct.
To avoid CO poisoning of Pt electrodes, we elected to go with Pt-Ru plates for now
Might change mind if cost is prohibitive 
Discussed support for electrode


Scratched the idea of vaporizing MeOH on hot plate and holding MEA on top

Start by pursuing passive feed

Read paper (Direct Methanol Fuel Cell, chapter 14)


Searched literature

Consulted with Joe




Future things to do:
Pursue both liquid and vapor feeds, and compare the merits of each
Carbon footprint of our materials
Make our own Pt-Ru nanoparticle/alloy
Pursue active control methods if given time
