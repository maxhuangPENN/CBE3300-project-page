Monday Mar 03

- Jack and Max in the lab
- we designed the circuitry and a feasible schedule to reach our design goals
- See picture here: https://github.com/maxhuangPENN/CBE3300-project-page/blob/main/IMG_5839.jpeg

- Picture explained:
    - We plan on controlling peristaltic pump with an Arduino-based circuitry
    - Load testing with oscilloscope

- Schedule:
    - Mar 03-07: Controls (Arduino code, circuit diagrams, peristaltic tubing compatibility)
    - Mar 10-14: Spring Break
    - Mar 17-21: Controls (Peristaltic pump calibration, soldering, oscilloscope load testing, and voltage readings using Processing IDE)
    - Mar 24-29: Integration 
    - April first week: Optimization (horizonal/vertical stack, varying [MeOH] and Q, pressure air feed, pure O2)



Sun Mar 02

- Max: updated this log, last updated by Max on Feb 21

Thur Feb 26

- All: Work on IDP presentation
- Max: clipped video together
- Max: conducted power calculations using Fuel Cell Store data sheet, and comparing to energy density estimations, with the guidance of Dr. Osuji and Dr. Huff

Wed Feb 25

- Ordered the 10-cell stack with Dr. Huff
- Max: researched peristaltic pumps and methanol-compatible tubing, submitted those for order as well
- Max: finalized GANTT Chart
- Karam and Jack: market and SWOT analysis, IDP slides

Monday Feb 24

- Jack: Received quote for 10-cell stack from Fuel Cell Store
- Jack and Max: Discussed pros and cons with Dr. Osuji
- Committed to operating the 10-cell stack
- Begun drafting a GANTT chart

Friday Feb 21, 2025

- Disassemble model PEM (Hydrogen/Oxygen electrolyzer), understand parts, inspect setup
- Jack: detail ways to vapor feed methanol
- Max: Find a way to extend use of PEM Electrolyzer for methanol 

- Jack and Max: produce H2 in a cartridge and run the education kit PEM

Friday Feb 14, 2025

- Max revised over all of the initial report and submitted it.

Thursday Feb 13, 2025

- Jack and Karam presented the initial report to class (concurrently, Max was fighting for his life in physics class)
- We've finalized our purchasing list, with links for each item
- We've submitted our finalized Prelim Report to Git
- Next week, we plan on meeting on Friday for the initial testing of our MVP with Dr. Huff's help.

Tuesday Feb 4, 2025

- We finished drafting the initial report
- We found this incredible textbook chapter (CH14 of "Methanol:Science and Engineering") from which we based a lot of our research
- We determined that there's too many moving factors
    - ex: diluting MeOH is good for reducing MeOH crossover through the MEA, 
          but also less water lets the cell run hotter and maximize chemical rates/efficiency

- Solution: do it experimentally and iterate on the dependence of active/passive control, liquid/vapor feed, cell geometry, fuel concentration, etc.


Jan 31, 2025

Karam, Jack, and Max met at 3:09 pm EST in Dr. Huff lab, unbeknownst to her. We had 2 Hersheys and a Hichew. We leave it to the reader to determine who had the Hichew.
The trio discussed drafting the preliminary report. By next Tuesday, we expect to each have completed our parts.
We will meet on Tuesday in conjunction with CBE 2310 recitation to give each other feedback and unite our work as one.
By Thursday, we are done.
By Friday, Joe has given us an A+ (feedback).

Vamos.


Jan 30, 2025

Discussed the merits of liquid vs. vapor feed for MeOH.
Considered alloys for electrodes
Have not considered cost so far
In the MeOH reduction mechanism, there is CO as byproduct.
To avoid CO poisoning of Pt electrodes, we elected to go with Pt-Ru plates for now
Might change mind if cost is prohibitive 
Discussed support for electrode


Scratched the idea of vaporizing MeOH on hot plate and holding MEA on top

Start by pursuing passive feed

Read paper (Direct Methanol Fuel Cell, chapter 14)


Searched literature

Consulted with Joe




Future things to do:
Pursue both liquid and vapor feeds, and compare the merits of each
Carbon footprint of our materials
Make our own Pt-Ru nanoparticle/alloy
Pursue active control methods if given time
