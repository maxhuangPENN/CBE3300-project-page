Tuesday March 25

- Jack's laptop fixed
- We ran our setup in the fume hood and obtained no voltage output
- The cell was running for about 2.5 mins with a 3% by weight MeOH feed, at 110 cc/min

- Potential errors we will try to debug, in order of most to least likely (we will work our way down this list):

	1. Fuel cell not activated, DMFCs often require hydration and/or warm-up time before delivering power. Let the stack soak for 10â€“20 minutes before testing again. Literature also suggest flowing lower MeOH concentrations at first and slowly ramping that up (and all this while operating fan, to ensure cathode isn't air-starved).
	2. Flow rate too high. The manufacturer specifies 10 cc/cell/min, which is why we aim to flow at 100 cc/min (10 cells). But we can imagine a world where there is insufficient residence time and where the MeOH flushes past the catalyst without enough time to react. We can experiment with lower flow rates.
	3. Not enough oxygen. The fume hood should do enough, but we can definitely increase airflow using the provided fan.
	4. MEA misalignment: when we disassemble the stack, we should look for misaligned MEAs. The common feedback for this kind of stack is that they are sometimes not aligned, but ours came with guide dowels, so this should not be an issue. The stack specifies 8-10 in-lbs of compression across the cell to ensure proper contact, but we have no way of properly measuring this, so we are putting this metric on the back burner for now.
    5. In case we suspect a faulty cell: Perhaps measure voltage 1 cell at a time to identify the faulty one.

Friday Feb 14, 2025

- Max revised over all of the initial report and submitted it.

Thursday Feb 13, 2025

- Jack and Karam presented the initial report to class (concurrently, Max was fighting for his life in physics class)
- We've finalized our purchasing list, with links for each item
- We've submitted our finalized Prelim Report to Git
- Next week, we plan on meeting on Friday for the initial testing of our MVP with Dr. Huff's help.

Tuesday Feb 4, 2025

- We finished drafting the initial report
- We found this incredible textbook chapter (CH14 of "Methanol:Science and Engineering") from which we based a lot of our research
- We determined that there's too many moving factors
    - ex: diluting MeOH is good for reducing MeOH crossover through the MEA, 
          but also less water lets the cell run hotter and maximize chemical rates/efficiency

- Solution: do it experimentally and iterate on the dependence of active/passive control, liquid/vapor feed, cell geometry, fuel concentration, etc.


Jan 31, 2025

Karam, Jack, and Max met at 3:09 pm EST in Dr. Huff lab, unbeknownst to her. We had 2 Hersheys and a Hichew. We leave it to the reader to determine who had the Hichew.
The trio discussed drafting the preliminary report. By next Tuesday, we expect to each have completed our parts.
We will meet on Tuesday in conjunction with CBE 2310 recitation to give each other feedback and unite our work as one.
By Thursday, we are done.
By Friday, Joe has given us an A+ (feedback).

Vamos.


Jan 30, 2025

Discussed the merits of liquid vs. vapor feed for MeOH.
Considered alloys for electrodes
Have not considered cost so far
In the MeOH reduction mechanism, there is CO as byproduct.
To avoid CO poisoning of Pt electrodes, we elected to go with Pt-Ru plates for now
Might change mind if cost is prohibitive 
Discussed support for electrode


Scratched the idea of vaporizing MeOH on hot plate and holding MEA on top

Start by pursuing passive feed

Read paper (Direct Methanol Fuel Cell, chapter 14)


Searched literature

Consulted with Joe




Future things to do:
Pursue both liquid and vapor feeds, and compare the merits of each
Carbon footprint of our materials
Make our own Pt-Ru nanoparticle/alloy
Pursue active control methods if given time
